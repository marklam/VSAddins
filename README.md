# VSAddins
The Show Ordered Build Output functionality in this extension is now available as part of [Mads Kristensen's "Tweaks" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.Tweaks2022)

I think the packaging of the extension in this repo is a bit wrong, since I never managed to get it to offer installation from inside Visual Studio.
